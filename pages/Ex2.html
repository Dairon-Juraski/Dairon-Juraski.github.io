<!-- Purpose Of This Tutorial -->          
        <h2>Purpose Of This Tutorial</h2>

        <p>This tutorial is written to help people understand some of the basics of <b>shell
                script</b> programming (aka <b>shell scripting</b>), and hopefully to introduce some of the possibilities of
            simple but
            powerful programming available under the Bourne shell. As such, it has been written as
            a basis for one-on-one or group tutorials and exercises, and as a reference for subsequent
            use. 
        </p>

<!-- A Brief History of sh --> 
        <h2>A Brief History of sh</h2>

        <p>Steve Bourne wrote the Bourne shell which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research
            version of Unix.
            <br />

            Many other shells have been written; this particular tutorial concentrates
            on the Bourne and the Bourne Again shells.<br />
            Other shells include the Korn Shell (ksh), the C Shell (csh), and variations such as tcsh.<br />
            This tutorial does <i>not</i> cover those shells.

        </p>

<!-- Audience -->
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>This tutorial assumes some prior experience; namely:</p>
        <ul class="circle">
            <li><b>Use of</b> an <b>interactive</b> Unix/Linux shell</li>
            <li><b>Minimal programming knowledge</b> - use of variables, functions, is useful background knowledge</li>
            <li>Understanding of <b>some</b> Unix/Linux commands, and <b>competence</b> in using <b>some</b> of the <b>more
                    common</b> ones. (<i>ls</i>, <i>cp</i>, <i>echo</i>, etc)</li>
            <li>Programmers of <b>ruby</b>, <b>perl</b>, <b>python</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>Pascal</b>, or any programming language
                (even BASIC) who can maybe read shell scripts,
                but don't feel they understand exactly how they work.</li>
        </ul>

<!-- Typographical Conventions Used in This Tutorial -->  
        <h2>Typographical Conventions Used in This Tutorial</h2>
        <p>
            Significant words will be written in <i>italics</i> when mentioned for the
            first time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Code segments and script output will be displayed as monospaced text.<br />
            Command-line entries will be preceded by the Dollar sign ($). If your prompt is different,
            enter the command: </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
            PS1=&quot;$ &quot; ; export PS1
        </pre>

        <p>Then your interactions should
            match the examples given (such as <code>./my-script.sh</code> below).
            <br />
            Script output (such as &quot;Hello World&quot; below) is displayed at the start of the line.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
            $ echo '#!/bin/sh' &gt; my-script.sh
            $ echo 'echo Hello World' &gt;&gt; my-script.sh
            $ chmod 755 my-script.sh
            $ ./my-script.sh
            Hello World
            $
        </pre>
        Entire scripts will be shown with a gray background, and include a reference to the plain text of the script, where
        available:
        <hr noshade="noshade" align="left" width="40%" />
        <h3>my-script.sh</h3>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
            #!/bin/sh
            # This is a comment!
            echo Hello World	# This is a comment, too!
        </pre>

        <hr noshade="noshade" align="left" width="40%" />
        Note that to make a file executable, you must set the eXecutable bit, and for a shell
        script, the Readable bit must also be set:
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
            $ chmod a+rx my-script.sh
            $ ./my-script.sh
        </pre>
        <br />
